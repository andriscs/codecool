**Time tracking system 01**

A desktop time tracker app, used only desktop, most likely in the same software environment.

_Complexity (1-5): 1_

- Cost of webapp is smaller
- It is only used at large screens, no need to access phone features

- native apps offer safer data transfer but this info is not so sensitive
- updates are easier to publish (although very rare updates are expected)
- easier to connect with the desktop version
- native apps would mean higher development and maintenance cost
